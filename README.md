Practice synthesizing a parking lot application.
Goals: Have a producer / consumer interaction that 
allows the consumer to easily use and run a parking lot mangent app 
that defines concrete lot structure while allowing behavior actors to be injectable.
The lot supervisor / velets are implemented to execute as a multi-threaded workerpool.
But another implementation or test of the concreate parking lot structures could
be single threaded, or could have backing persistance etc.
